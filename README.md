# WeatherApp
Udacity Weather App project

-Introduction

This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App

-Development Strategy

For this project, you will be writing most of your code in two files: server.js and website/app.js. Note that it's very important that you plan your project before you start writing any code! Break your project down into small pieces of work and strategize your approach to each one. With these bite-sized amounts, it'll be easier to debug and fix any issues that appear.
